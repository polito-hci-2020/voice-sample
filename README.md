# Text-to-speech and speech-to-text examples

This repository is an example for using text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities.

It uses the Web Speech API (experimental) for speech-to-text and text-to-speech operations. It just echoes the speech of a user.

Tested in Chrome 57+, Firefox 70+, and Safari 10.1+. Please, notice that speech-to-text capability does not work in Safari and Firefox.
